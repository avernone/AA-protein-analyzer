# AA Protein Analyser

**AA-Protein-Analyzer** is an interactive web application built entirely in **Python**.
It uses the **Streamlit framework** to provide a simple and efficient interface for data visualization and web deployment.
The app retrieves protein sequences from **UniProt** (https://www.uniprot.org/), computes amino acid frequencies and specific ratios (E/Q, E/P, Y/F, D/N, G/S), and exports results in Excel format.

### Ratio-based amino acid analysis

Beyond individual amino acid frequencies, the app computes specific ratios between selected residue pairs (E/Q, E/P, Y/F, D/N, G/S).
